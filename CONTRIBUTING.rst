Contributing
=============

The Congress wiki page is the authoritative starting point.

   https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Congress

If you would like to contribute to the development of any OpenStack
project including Congress,
you must follow the steps in the "If you're a developer, start here"
section of this page:

   http://wiki.openstack.org/HowToContribute

Once those steps have been completed, changes to OpenStack
should be submitted for review via the Gerrit tool, following
the workflow documented at:

   http://wiki.openstack.org/GerritWorkflow

Pull requests submitted through GitHub will be ignored.

Bugs should be filed on Launchpad, not GitHub:
