Quickstart
==========

Installation
------------
To install and run::

     $ cd congress
     $ make
     TODO: explain how to startup the service


Change available cloud services
-------------------------------
Information about the available cloud services is stored as a policy within Congress; hence, you can modify it when Congress is running and it will adapt accordingly.  The format is fairly self-explanatory.

TODO:show api calls that insert cloud service descriptions into the appropriate theory.

TODO: show which file on disk has the startup contents of that policy
