Congress runs as a standalone cloud service.  You execute commands by sending
Congress HTTP requests.  Instructions for starting the Congress web server can
be found in the :ref:`Readme <readme>` file.  The format for HTTP requests can
be found later in this documentation.


Currently we have no instructions for embedding Congress within another
project.  If you are interested in doing so, let us know via the Openstack-dev
mailing list with [Congress] in the subject or by sending email to the
addresses listed on the wiki.
